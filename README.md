# Building Machine Learning Model

The raw data used for this machine learning project is 2020 NFL play data. This was a fairly large csv file comprised of 46,189 rows and 43 columns.

The ability of an offensive team to successfullly convert third downs is key to their ability to move down the field to score if trailing the other team, or to maintain possession, and run the clock down to end game. 

Analysis of the raw data revealed there were many data points that were uneeded. A new dataframe was created utilizing six columns
